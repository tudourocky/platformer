# Science Acacdemy 2D fighter

### Purpose
The purpose of this game was to demonstrate our team's ability to create a project from start to finish and our learning during our time in Science Academy. 

### Idiation Stage

We wanted to create a game that is interactive in a presentation setting, therefore we wanted to create a game that envolves multiplayer. We also lack the ability to create 3D Assets, so we decided that we will stick with a 2D game and use pixel art so that we can empathize on getting a game running. With all these things combined, our team ended up choosing to make something similar to the classic game Street Fighters. 

### Use of Technology

- We decided on using Unity 2D due to the huge amount of tutorials that are avaliable online.
- We used Github to both collabrate and version control
- We used Aseprite to create the pixel art
- We used Bosca Ceoil to create BGM and FreeSound for SFX
